2. Podcast Details
- When a user selects a podcast, they are taken to a detailed view, which includes:

Option to play or download individual episodes

3. Episode Playback
- Users can play episodes directly within the app, with controls for play and pause.

4. Search Functionality
The app includes a search bar, allowing users to find podcasts by keyword, title, or description.
